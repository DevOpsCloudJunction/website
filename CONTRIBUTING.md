# Contributing to **DevOpsCloudJunction** Website Repo

Welcome to the **DevOpsCloudJunction** **website** contributing guide. We are thrilled to have you join our community! Whether you’re contributing code, blog, or helping with discussions, your input is valued.

If you are interested in contributing, start by reading this document. Please also take a look at our **[Code of conduct](https://github.com/DevOpsCloudJunction/website/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**


## Our Workflow 

Contributing to [DevOpsCloudJunction Website](https://devopscloudjunction.com/) should be as simple as possible. Have a question? Want to discuss something? Want to contribute something? Just open an [Issue](https://github.com/DevOpsCloudJunction/website/issues), a [Pull Request](https://github.com/DevOpsCloudJunction/website/pulls).

If you spot a bug or want to change something pretty simple, just go ahead and open an `Issue` and/or a `Pull Request`, including your changes at [DevOpsCloudJunction/website](https://github.com/DevOpsCloudJunction/website)

## Gettting Started

### Identifying Issues

Pull requests that resolve existing GitHub issues are generally prioritized higher than those that don't. You can use the available issue labels to find relevant and interesting tasks.

For newcomers, we recommend starting with issues labeled as `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

Once you find an issue that grabs your interest, leave a comment on the issue asking the maintainers to assign it to you.

### Contributor compliance with Developer Certificate Of Origin (DCO)

We require every contributor to certify that they are legally permitted to contribute to our project.
A contributor expresses this by consciously signing their commits, and by this act expressing that
they comply with the [Developer Certificate Of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

A signed commit is a commit where the commit message contains the following content:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <jdoe@example.org>
```

This can be done by adding [`--signoff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) to your git command line.

### Submitting Pull Requests

PR titles should follow this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```
Refer to [conventions](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) for more details on types and scopes.

When submitting a pull request, clearly:

- **Describe the problem** you're solving, linking to relevant GitHub issues.
- **Describe your solution** with links to design documentation or discussions.
- **Define how you tested and validated** your solution.
- **Update relevant documentation** and examples, if needed.

Smaller pull requests are generally easier to review and merge. Collaborate with maintainers to determine how to break up larger PRs, if necessary.


### Filling Details in PR Template

When raising a pull request, ensure you fill out the PR template fields. Some fields may not apply to your PR, but it’s important to provide proper details for **Change Overview** and **Test Plan**. These fields provide the necessary context to facilitate the PR review process.
