## Blog Contribution Guide

Follow these steps to add a new blog post:

### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your blog post:

```bash
git checkout -b sample-blog
```

### Create Blog Directory

Navigate to the `content/en/blog` directory and create a new folder for your blog. Use the following command to automate the process:

```bash
hugo new blog/<blog-name>/index.md
```

> Replace `<blog-name>` with a meaningful name related to your blog topic. 

Alternatively, you can manually create a folder and copy the `index.md` from an existing blog post, like `say-hello-to-devopscloudjunction`.

### Edit Your Blog Post

Edit the `index.md` file and update the fields:

- **Title**: Add your blog title.
- **Description**: Provide a brief summary of your blog.
- **Image**: Include an image. Use either a relevant image or the default `dcj.jpeg` located at `images/dcj.jpeg`.

For **code highlighting**, refer to [The Code Buzz](https://www.thecodebuzz.com/highlight-bash-shell-code-in-markdown-readme-md-wiki-files/).

```bash
hugo server
```

    git add .
    git commit -m "Added blog: <your-blog-title>"
    ```

2. **Push the branch** and create a pull request:

    ```bash
    git push origin sample-blog
    ```

### Merge the Branch
